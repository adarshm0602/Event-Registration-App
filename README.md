Event Registration & Attendee Management – Salesforce Application:

Project Overview

The Event Registration & Attendee Management System is a Salesforce-based solution designed to digitize and centralize event organization activities.
The goal is to streamline event creation, attendee registration, and automated confirmation communication, while also providing organizers with real-time dashboards and reports.

This solution enables:

Event managers to create and track events.

Attendees to register easily.

Automatic confirmation emails upon successful registration.

Reports & Dashboards showing registrations per event for better decision-making.

Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
Problem Statement

Event organizers often face challenges such as:

Manual attendee registrations (spreadsheets, paper forms).

Lack of automated communication with attendees.

Difficulty in tracking event capacity and attendance.

No central dashboard to view registrations across events.

Solution

A Salesforce-based centralized system to:

Manage Events and Attendees using custom objects.

Create relationships between events and attendees.

Automate confirmation emails via Flows & Email Alerts.

Provide real-time dashboards to track attendees per event.

Phase 2: Org Setup & Configuration

Created a Salesforce Developer Org.

Enabled Lightning Experience.

Configured Tabs, App Launcher access, and Object permissions.

Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships

Custom Objects:

Event → Stores event details (Name, Date, Location, Capacity).

Attendee → Stores attendee details (Name, Email, Registered Event).

Relationships:

Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)

Built a Record-Triggered Flow on Attendee creation.

Configured Email Alerts linked to the Flow.
